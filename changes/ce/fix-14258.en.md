Lower QUIC connection shutdown timeout.

For QUIC connection graceful shutdown, we used to have 5s timeout.

If the client is unresponsive for graceful shutdown, EMQX may generate some warning logs:

```
[warning] msg: session_stepdown_request_timeout, action: discard, 
```
or 

timeout the dashboard if kick the client via dashboard. 

Now lower it to 1s for reason `kick` and 3s for the others.
