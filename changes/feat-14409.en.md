Add two rule functions to convert UTF-8 strings to UTF-16-little-endian for compatibility with SQL Server versions that do not support UTF-8.

- Convert a UTF-8 string to UTF-16-little-endian.
  `str_utf16_le/1`

- Convert any string or Binary to SQL Server hex binary format with `0x` prefix.
  `sqlserver_bin2hexstr/1`
